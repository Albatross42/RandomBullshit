-The flexbox framework is kinda working even though the calendar is still larger than the container.
-The calendar will be a usable option. Was able to make multiple and identified how to distribute differnt sets of data to each. I was also able to turn the day a color of desire. 
-We know from sandbox testing that the vue-chartjs library is going to deliver what we need.
-So my next task is to test the excel to json functionality. 
  What will the data look like? 
  How do we make it accessable to the app? 
  Can we manipulate it once its arrived? before?
the vue-json-excel library is for downloading to excel. Not what I'm looking for, but good to know it exists.
Found some good information here https://www.folkstalk.com/2022/07/get-data-from-excel-using-vue-js-with-code-examples.html. Might be useful
read-excel-file seems to be my solution. It has validation and can generate a 'custom' json which may be what I need to manipulate it to the format the graphs and calendars need.
This one doesn't work anymore, but may have at some point. https://codesandbox.io/s/nervous-montalcini-w3qhy?file=/src/App.vue

I think this is it - https://vue-xlsx.netlify.app/guide/#installation. Let's try more tm.


Tasks:

-Develope a JSON that stores calendar data. Write loop to populate the month. 
-Responsive at small sizes.


Notes:

Resouces used to get the calenar up and running:
https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components/layout
https://vcalendar.io/layouts.html#full-width
https://codesandbox.io/s/ll2orom14m?file=/src/main.js
https://github.com/nathanreyes/v-calendar/issues/143

So I need to pull the data from the excel spreadsheet and push it into the graph array. 
The way the object lays out is clearly defined in the syntax. 
I should be able to change information within the object with the js.
